## Description

The app allows users to view create and track daily workouts. They are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. As well as being able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, users are able to track their distance traveled..

The backend functionality of the app comes from Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.

## Installation 

* Run npm i to install all dependencies. 
* Run npm start to run the app locally.
